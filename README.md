Packet modification to fool machine learning based network intrusion detection systems.

## System Overview
The goal of our system is to modify malicious traffic to make it appear benign to a target Intrusion Detection System (IDS). 
However, the important constraint in our project is that our modifications to traffic must not affect their functionality downstream!
