Defense mechanisms in a cloud computing environment
============================

Summary
=========
The major need for DDOS detection is low-rate DDOSS traffic. High rate traffic is trivial to detect.
Availability is of upmost importance in cloud-computing services since their purpose is to offer on-demand service.

Two types of DDoS attacks: Brute force and semantic
- Semantic attacks exploit protocol weaknesses. These are known as low-rate attacks.
Low rate attacks in one of four categories:
- Shrew attack
- Reduction of Quality attack (RoQ)
- Low Rate DDoS attack against Application Server(LoRDAS)
- Economic Denial-of-Sustainability attack


Detection approaches:
========================
Pattern matching and fingerprinting:
